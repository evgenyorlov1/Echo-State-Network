0. implement PCA
1. add classification choice
2. refactor train for individual methods. Classification is the same for all methods.
3. switch from sklearn to numpy
4. add logger
5. tichonov regularization
6. loader function they write on their own
7. data input is about 1GB
8. error calculations
9. plot results
10. over fitting training error
11. move somewhere harvest method

Plan:
20/04 -- PCA algorithm
21/04 -- measure accuracy of new code
21/04 -- ridge regression
22/04 -- sparse matrix
23/04 -- auto decoder
23/04 -- train it on ecg dataset
24/04 -- deadline
